# Security fundamentals # 


## Build layers of defenses. ##

_When you rely on just one line of defense, and that line gets compromised, you are left unprotected._

**Castle metaphore**, it used to rely on a canal, fortified outer walls, a second interior wall and a keep within.

Apply the above on a corporate network, it's not just done by buying one strong Firewall appliance.

Should be **security by layers** or **defense by depth**.

## Permissions ##
Leverage **Just Enough Administration**.
Don't give every user "super user" rights on a domain or network.

Use **Principle of least privilege** just the right amount to do daily tasks.

Give sysadmins a DA_ account for maintenence, this would give more insite into changes made on the infrastructure.
